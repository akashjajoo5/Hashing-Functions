# Hashing-Functions
### Implementation
1. Implemented Multi-Hashing, Cuckoo and d-Left hashing tables in Java.
2. Kindly refer _project1.pdf_ for project requirements and to understand the input format for the file.

### How to Execute the code
1. Download HashTables.java and compile the file using `javac HashTables.java`.
2. A class file will be generated named **HashTables.class**, execute the file using `java HashTables`.
3. Enter the desired input for all three Hash Tables and the output file of each hash table will be generated in the same folder.

### Output format
1. First line of the output file shows the number of flow ids successfully inserted in the hash table. 
2. The following lines show the **flowID** stored at different index in the table (0 to n-1) entries where n is the number of table entries.
